2. Display types
	- block: do not allow other block elements to be in same line, default take up 100% of container e.g. <p></p>
	- inline: only left and margin, dimentions determined by content (doesnt require own line), no ability to change height or width, e.g. <a></a><span></span> (doesnt force itself into new line ='inline') <span></span> is used to group things you want to edit together
