Day 6
Questions?

	• text-align: center
	• vertical-align: middle
	• mozilla website - best for resource for css and html
	• google 'question' site:stackoverflow.com and mozilla
	• Use border when you want to see an outline
	• Margin PUSHES other boxes away from you
	• Padding creates INTERNAL space
	• Dimensions, margin/border/padding, styles applied to that element - and can manipulate it

Agenda:
1. Normalize
2. Advanced CSS selectors
3. Mockup lab

Notes:
	• Reset
		Each browser has some default settings (e.g. styling)
		A way to get around it is reeset - it's a stylesheet that wipes out all the default styling.
		No styling.
		Copy + paste + stylesheet + link
	• Normalising
		Instead of removing default setting, it makes all default settings the same for all browsers 

Three selectors:
1. tag-based example <a></a>
2. id
3. class

Relational
Pseudo-class

Relational
• Adjacent sibling +
• General sibling -
• Direct child >
• Descendant 
See style.css

Pseudo-class
• Target specific elements based mainly on relationships 
• e.g. first child, just first <li></li>
